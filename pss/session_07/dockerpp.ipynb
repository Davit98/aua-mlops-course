    "> In addition to the most common read/write/execute file permissions, there are some additional modes that you might find useful, specifically the `+t` mode (sticky bit) and the `+s` mode (setuid bit). These functions describe the behavior of files and executables in multi-user situations.\n",
    "\n",
    ">When set on a directory, the sticky bit, or `+t` mode, means that only the owner (or root) can delete or rename files within that directory, regardless of which users have write access to the directory by way of group membership or ownership. This is useful when a directory is owned by a group through which a number of users share write access to a given set of files.\n",
    "It’s important to note that setting the sticky bit on a file does not prevent a user with write permissions to the enclosing directory from deleting or renaming the file—the sticky bit must be set on the enclosing directory. The sticky bit has no function on modern Linux systems when set on files.\n",
    "To set the sticky bit on a directory named **my_directory**, issue the following command: `chmod +t my_directory`\n",
    "To remove the sticky bit from a file or directory, use the `chmod -t` command. Note, to change the sticky bit, you need to be either root or the file/directory owner. The root user is able to delete directories and files within them regardless of the status of the sticky bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The setuid bit, or `+s`, when set on files allows users with permissions to execute a given file to run that file with the permissions of file owner. For instance, if the file was owned by the root user and the marketing group, members of the marketing group could run the program (file) as if they were the root user. This may pose potential security risks in some cases and executables should be properly evaluated before receiving the `+s` flag. To set the `+s` bit on a file named **file**, issue the following command: `chmod g+s file`.\n",
    "In contrast to the `+s` mode for the ownership of a file, the effect of the `+s` mode on a directory is somewhat different. Files created in `+s` directories receive the ownership of that directory’s user and group, rather than the ownership of the user that created the file and their default group. "
