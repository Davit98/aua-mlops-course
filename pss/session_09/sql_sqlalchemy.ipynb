    "In Python, `__name__` is a special variable that is automatically defined for every module. It is used to determine if a module is being run as the main program or if it is being imported as a module into another program.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a Python script is executed, the interpreter sets the `__name__` variable to `\"__main__\"`. This indicates that the script is being run as the main program. On the other hand, if a module is imported into another program, its `__name__` variable is set to the module name.\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior is useful when writing Python scripts that can be used both as standalone programs and as modules that can be imported into other programs. By using the `__name__` variable, you can write code that is only executed when the script is run as the main program, but not when it is imported as a module."

    "## SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It is used to create, modify, and query databases, and is considered one of the most popular and widely used database languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is used to communicate with databases and perform operations like retrieving data, inserting data, updating data, and deleting data. It is used in a variety of applications, such as online banking, e-commerce, inventory management, and data analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL is a declarative language**, which means that users simply declare what they want to do with the data, and the database management system figures out how to do it. SQL syntax is relatively easy to learn and understand, and it is supported by many relational database management systems, including MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL works under the hood by interacting with a database management system (DBMS). When a user sends an SQL query to the DBMS, the query is first parsed and checked for errors. If the query is valid, the **DBMS uses an optimizer to create an execution plan that determines the most efficient way to execute the query**. The execution plan involves several steps, including parsing the query, optimizing the plan, and executing the plan. The plan may involve accessing data from one or more tables, joining tables together, filtering data based on specified criteria, and returning the results to the user. When a query is executed, the DBMS may use various techniques to optimize performance, such as caching frequently accessed data in memory, creating indexes to speed up searches, and using parallel processing to execute multiple parts of a query at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A **DBMS** is a software system that provides tools for managing and manipulating data stored in a database. It typically includes features for creating, modifying, and querying the database, as well as tools for managing users, security, backups, and other administrative tasks.  \n",
    "> A **database engine**, on the other hand, is the core software component of a DBMS that is responsible for storing, retrieving, and managing data. It is the part of the DBMS that handles low-level data operations, such as reading and writing data to disk, indexing data for faster retrieval, and managing transactions to ensure data consistency.  \n",
    "> While the terms DBMS and database engine can sometimes be used interchangeably, they can also be used to refer to different aspects of a database system. In general, the DBMS is the overall system that provides tools for managing and manipulating data, while the database engine is the software component that actually manages the data at a low level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the core keywords in SQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SELECT**: used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database.  \n",
    "- **FROM**: used to specify the table or tables from which to retrieve data.  \n",
    "- **WHERE**: used to specify filtering criteria for selecting data.  \n",
    "- **JOIN**: used to combine data from two or more tables based on a related column.  \n",
    "- **INSERT**: used to add new data to a table.  \n",
    "- **UPDATE**: used to modify existing data in a table.  \n",
    "- **DELETE**: used to remove data from a table.  \n",
    "- **CREATE**: used to create new tables, views, or other database objects.  \n",
    "- **ALTER**: used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as a table or view.  \n",
    "- **DROP**: used to delete an existing database object.  \n",
    "- **GROUP** BY: used to group data based on one or more columns.  \n",
    "- **HAVING**: used to filter grouped data based on specified criteria.  \n",
    "- **ORDER BY**: used to sort data based on one or more columns.  \n",
    "- **DISTINCT**: used to retrieve unique values from a column.  \n",
    "- **COUNT**: used to count the number of rows or non-null values in a column.  "

    "In a relational database, a **primary key** is a unique identifier for a record in a table. It is a column or a combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in the table. The primary key is used to enforce referential integrity and to ensure that each row in the table can be uniquely identified. A primary key must be unique, not null, and cannot be changed once it has been set.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **foreign key**, on the other hand, is a field or combination of fields in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It is used to establish a relationship between two tables in a relational database. A foreign key is a column in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. It is used to enforce referential integrity, which ensures that the data in related tables is consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a foreign key is created, a relationship is established between two tables. The table that contains the foreign key is called the referencing table or child table, and the table that contains the primary key is called the referenced table or parent table. The foreign key in the referencing table must have the same data type as the primary key in the referenced table. The foreign key can be null, which means that a row in the referencing table can exist without a corresponding row in the referenced table.\n",

    "- Unique: A primary key must be unique and cannot contain duplicate values.\n",
    "- Non-null: A primary key cannot contain null values. Every record in the table must have a primary key value.\n",
    "- Unchangeable: Once a primary key value is set, it cannot be changed or updated.\n",
    "- Single-valued: A primary key must contain a single value, i.e., it cannot be a combination of multiple columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Foreign key**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Referential integrity: A foreign key ensures that the values in the referencing table (child table) match the values in the referenced table (parent table).\n",
    "- Non-null: A foreign key can contain null values, but only if the referencing column is allowed to have nulls.\n",
    "- Relationship: A foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables in a relational database.\n",
    "- Data type: The data type of the foreign key column must match the data type of the primary key column in the referenced table.\n",
    "- Cascade actions: Foreign keys can be configured to take actions when the referenced record is updated or deleted. For example, you can specify that all referencing records are also updated or deleted when the referenced record is updated or deleted. This is known as a cascading update or delete.\n",

    "<center><img src=\"./images/primary_foreign_keys.png\" width=900 height = 200/></center>\n",

    "If a foreign key column in the referencing table contains a null value, it means that there is no corresponding record in the referenced table with the same primary key value. In other words, the relationship between the two tables is not established for that particular record. However, it's important to note that the use of null values in foreign keys can sometimes lead to data inconsistency or referential integrity issues, especially when a foreign key is part of a composite key (a combination of multiple columns). Therefore, it's generally recommended to avoid using null values in foreign keys, or to use them only when absolutely necessary and with careful consideration of the potential implications."

    "ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) provides several advantages, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplified Database Access**: ORM provides a simplified way to interact with databases. Developers can use ORM frameworks to write SQL queries in an object-oriented way, which makes it easier to read, write, and maintain database code. This saves time and effort by reducing the amount of manual database manipulation code that developers need to write.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Platform Independence**: ORM provides a way to write database access code that is independent of the database management system (DBMS) being used. This means that developers can write code that works with any DBMS supported by the ORM framework, without having to worry about the specifics of the underlying database system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improved Code Quality**: ORM helps improve the quality of code by reducing the amount of boilerplate code that developers need to write. ORM frameworks provide many built-in features, such as caching, object validation, and data conversion, which can help reduce the amount of custom code that developers need to write. This makes the code more concise, easier to read, and less prone to errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Object-Oriented Programming**: ORM provides a way to use object-oriented programming techniques to interact with databases. This makes it easier to represent the database schema as a set of objects, which can help improve code readability and maintainability."

A lower pool size can conserve resources, but may lead to performance issues if there are too many concurrent users.\n",
